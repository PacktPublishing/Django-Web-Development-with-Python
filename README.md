*	Find out how to get feedback while your application is used by your users
*	Create shared data access using a local SQLite database and a REST service
*	Test and monitor your applications
*	Gain memory management skills to avoid memory leaks and premature code cycles while decreasing the memory print of your applications
*	Integrate network resources with cross-platform applications
*	Design and implement eye-catching and reusable UI components without compromising nativity in mobile applications

##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

You will see code something similar to the following:

```
 if __name__ == "__main__":
    os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "Work_manager.settings")

    from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

    execute_from_command_line(sys.argv) 
```
