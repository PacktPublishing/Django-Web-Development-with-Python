##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

You will see code something similar to the following:

```
 if __name__ == "__main__":
    os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "Work_manager.settings")

    from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

    execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)
